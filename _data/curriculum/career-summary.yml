summary: "I am an active, creative person who likes to learn and discover new things.
I organize my time to make the most of it, from a meetup about React (for example) to a breakfast with friends. 
Breaking the routine is something I need, an afternoon of surfing or laser combat with my team is like a breath of fresh air.
<br></br>

I enjoy doing my work, focusing on the details and thinking about performance and usability with a global perspective. 
I am directing my career towards the frontend development, I feel it as a more creative part of computing and for me time passes much faster :)
<br></br>
I would like to work in an agile environment with professional and committed people, where I have challenges to overcome and where I can continue learning top technologies and building my career.
