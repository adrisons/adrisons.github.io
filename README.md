## Hello!

This is my personal page. Here's the [link](https://adrisons.github.io/).

## How
It is created using GitHub Pages and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in this site, from the content in the Markdown files.

## Install

See [Jekyll official page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#rbenv).

## Run
On a terminal type:
```bash
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
On a browser go to: http://127.0.0.1:4000

## My Visual Studio Code settings
